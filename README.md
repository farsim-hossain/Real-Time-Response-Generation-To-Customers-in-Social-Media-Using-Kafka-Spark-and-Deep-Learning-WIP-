# Real-Time-Response-Generation-To-Customers-in-Social-Media-Using-Kafka-Spark-and-Deep-Learning-WIP-
This project is about an integrated system to manage and respond to user complaints on social media platforms, with a primary focus on Twitter. Key components include leveraging Tweepy and Kafka for data ingestion, Spark for distributed processing, and machine learning models for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and complaint classification. The system's ability to filter and categorize tweets based on sentiment and topic enables efficient routing to relevant departments for resolution. Deployment of an API server facilitates response generation and integration with Twitter for posting replies to users. Through continuous monitoring and optimization, the system ensures prompt and accurate handling of user grievances, enhancing overall customer satisfaction and engagement on social media platforms.
